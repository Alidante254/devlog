# Devlog Site
A blog site for devlopers where you can post/find docs on how to develop applications.

## Overview
In most websites you only find documentation about a single framework or programming language. This is not ideal since in most development cases you mostly need many framework to get your app running. So dev docs solves this problem by providing documentation on how to develop an app from scratch listing all the frameworks and steps involved.

## How it works
1. You find a documentation with the title of the kind of app you want to build.
2. You get a list of frameworks that can be used for such development and you choose the ones you want.
3. You get a blog that explains how to develop an app fully using those frameworks or language from start to end.
4. The documentation explains what needs to be downloaded and the standard folder structure for such an app.
5. You then find more detailed explanation including sample code snippets and finnaly how to deploy the application.
