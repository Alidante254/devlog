# Devlog Site
A blog site for devlopers where you can post/find docs on how to develop applications.

## Overview
In most websites you only find documentation about a single framework or programming language. This is not ideal since in most development cases you mostly need many framework to get your app running. So dev docs solves this problem by providing documentation on how to develop an app from scratch listing all the frameworks and steps involved.
